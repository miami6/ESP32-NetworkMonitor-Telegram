# This ESP32-Based Wi-Fi Logger Is a Simple Network Monitoring Solution

# Element14 Presents host Mark Donners' Wi-Fi network monitor provides real-time alerts via Telegram with just an ESP32.

## Why build a network monitor?
Unlike the publicly accessible Wi-Fi network available in airports, cafes, and sporting events, your home Wi-Fi network is supposed to be safe. 
However, as element14 Presents host Mark Donners points out, providing the credentials to visitors can create a risk, 
especially if that password is further shared. In order to help himself more quickly identify unknown devices,
Donners set out to create an inexpensive network monitoring tool that could alert him whenever something connects.
